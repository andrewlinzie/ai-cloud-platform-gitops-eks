# AI Cloud Platform - EKS + GitOps Delivery System

This project is a production-style cloud platform that demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage a modern microservices system using:
- AWS EKS (Kubernetes)
- GitOps with ArgoCD
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Hybrid architecture (EKS + EC2 + Jenkins)

The system is designed to reflect real-world platform engineering practices, not just isolated components.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Modern teams often struggle with fragmented deployment workflows, inconsistent environments, and unclear ownership between infrastructure and application delivery.

Common challenges include:

- Rebuilding artifacts for each environment, leading to inconsistencies
- Manual deployments and lack of traceability
- Blurred responsibilities between infrastructure, CI/CD, and runtime systems
- Difficulty scaling services reliably under changing load
- Overengineering internal tools that don’t require full platform complexity

## 💡 Solution Approach

This project addresses these challenges by designing a platform that enforces:

- **Clear separation of concerns**
  - Terraform -> infrastructure
  - CI pipelines -> build and artifact creation
  - GitOps (ArgoCD) -> deployment state and reconciliation

- **Immutable deployment strategy**
  - Build once -> promote across environments
  - Eliminates environment drift

- **Git as the single source of truth**
  - Every deployment is traceable via commit history

- **Scalable runtime behavior**
  - Kubernetes-based autoscaling for API and AI services

- **Pragmatic system design**
  - Kubernetes used where needed (microservices)
  - Simpler EC2-based deployment for internal CMS

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This platform was intentionally designed to reflect real-world tradeoffs:

- Not all systems require Kubernetes -> CMS remains on EC2
- Deployment systems should be decoupled -> GitOps separates CI and CD
- Simplicity is preferred where possible -> avoid unnecessary complexity
- Systems should be observable and debuggable from day one

The result is a platform that is:
- scalable
- traceable
- maintainable
- aligned with real-world engineering constraints

# 🧠 System Overview

This platform consists of:

## 🔹 Microservices (EKS)
- api-service -> public-facing API (entry point)
- ai-inference-service -> internal AI processing service

## 🔹 Internal System (EC2)
- cms-monolith -> internal content management system (Docker + Jenkins)

## 🔹 Platform Infrastructure
- terraform-platform -> AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, IAM, ECR, EC2)
- gitops-infra -> Kubernetes deployment state (source of truth for workloads)

# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

<img width="4769" height="1428" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d642eb-12e7-4763-904d-8d92914e149d" />

This platform implements a GitOps-based deployment model in which CI pipelines build immutable Docker images and update the deployment state in a GitOps repository. ArgoCD continuously reconciles this state into an EKS cluster, while Terraform manages the underlying AWS infrastructure.

The diagram focuses on the implemented build, deployment, and runtime architecture. Additional capabilities such as autoscaling, load testing, and observability are described below.

# ⚙️ Core Design Principles

## 1. Separation of Concerns

Each system has clear ownership boundaries:
- Terraform
  - Owns AWS infrastructure (EKS, VPC, IAM, EC2)
- GitOps (ArgoCD)
  - Owns Kubernetes deployment state
- Service Repos
  - Own build + artifact creation only
- No overlapping responsibility

## 2. GitOps Deployment Model

This platform follows a true GitOps workflow:
- No direct kubectl apply
- No deployments from CI pipelines
- Git is the single source of truth

CI updates:

`
gitops-infra/dev/api-service/values.yaml
`

ArgoCD:
- Watches repo
- Detects changes
- Applies them to the cluster

## 3. Build Once, Promote Everywhere

The system uses immutable artifacts:
- Docker images tagged with commit SHA
- Same image promoted across environments

`
dev -> staging -> prod
`

No rebuilding per environment.

## 4. Environment Promotion Strategy

| Environment | Deployment Type |
|-------------|-----------------|
| dev	      | automatic       |
| staging     | manual approval |
| prod	      | manual approval |

This reduces blast radius and enforces controlled releases.

# 🔄 Example Deployment Flow (API Service)

When code is pushed to api-service:

## Step 1 - CI Pipeline Starts

GitHub Actions triggers the workflow.

## Step 2 — Validation (Quality Gate)
- Linting
- Tests

If this fails → pipeline stops

## Step 3 — Build Artifact
- Docker image is built
- Tagged with commit SHA

Example:

`
api-service:abc123
`

## Step 4 — Secure AWS Access (OIDC)
- No stored AWS credentials
- GitHub assumes IAM role dynamically

## Step 5 — Push to ECR

Image is stored in:

`
Amazon ECR
`

## Step 6 — Update GitOps Repo

Pipeline updates:

`
gitops-infra/dev/api-service/values.yaml
`

Only change:

`
image.tag = <commit SHA>
`

## Step 7 — ArgoCD Deploys

ArgoCD:
- Detects Git change
- Syncs cluster
- Rolls out new version

## 🔁 Result

`
push -> test -> build -> push -> update Git -> Argo deploys
`

---

# 🧱 Infrastructure (Terraform)

Terraform is used to provision:
- VPC (public/private subnets)
- EKS cluster + node groups
- IAM roles and policies
- ECR repositories
- EC2 instance for CMS
- Remote state (S3 + DynamoDB)

## Terraform Execution Model
- Runs via GitHub Actions
- Uses OIDC (no static credentials)
- Environment-based execution:
  - dev -> auto apply
  - staging -> approval required
  - prod -> approval required

# 🔧 Hybrid Architecture (Intentional)

This system is intentionally not fully Kubernetes-based:

| Component  | Runtime |
|------------|---------|
|API Service | EKS     |
|AI Inference| EKS     |
|CMS Monolith| EC2     |

## Why?

The CMS is:
- Internal-facing
- Low concurrency
- Operationally simpler

So it uses:
- Docker
- EC2
- Jenkins

Instead of unnecessary Kubernetes complexity.

---

# 📦 CI/CD Systems

## GitHub Actions (Microservices + Infra)
- API & AI services
- Terraform pipelines

## Jenkins (CMS)
- Builds CMS image
- Deploys to EC2
- Handles container lifecycle

---

# ⚡ System Behavior & Scalability

The platform is designed to handle varying levels of traffic and demonstrates runtime scalability through Kubernetes-native mechanisms.

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

- Both the API service and AI inference service are configured with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Scaling is driven by resource utilization:
  - API Service -> CPU-based scaling
  - AI Inference Service -> Memory-based scaling
- Pods automatically scale up under load and scale down during low traffic

## Load Testing Validation

- Load testing was performed against the API service to validate autoscaling behavior
- Pod scaling was observed in response to increased request volume
- The system maintained responsiveness during traffic spikes

Note: The AI inference service was not explicitly load tested, but is configured with HPA using memory-based scaling thresholds.

### Demo: Live Autoscaling Behavior

Watch the live validation of HPA scaling under load:

https://www.loom.com/share/24ece9c992d9442e9064acee23fd7317

Summary of what is demonstrated:

- API service receives sustained request load
- CPU utilization increases beyond the HPA threshold
- Replica count scales up automatically
- New pods are scheduled and become ready
- After load stops, replicas scale back down to baseline

This demonstrates real-time autoscaling behavior in a live Kubernetes environment.

# 🔍 Observability & Reliability

The platform now includes a production-style observability layer across application, platform, infrastructure, and deployment systems.

## Observability Stack

| Layer | Tool | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Application Metrics | Prometheus | API and AI service metrics exposed through `/metrics` |
| Kubernetes Runtime | Prometheus | Pod health, resource usage, restarts, and runtime behavior |
| Dashboards | Grafana | API, AI inference, and platform dashboards |
| AWS Infrastructure | CloudWatch | CMS EC2 health and CPU alarms |
| Deployment Visibility | ArgoCD | GitOps sync status, health, and drift visibility |
| CI/CD Visibility | GitHub Actions + Jenkins | Build, deploy, and pipeline execution history |

## Metrics Implemented

### API Service

- Request rate
- Success rate
- Error count
- p95 / p99 latency
- Downstream AI latency
- Pod replacement and restart visibility

### AI Inference Service

- Inference request rate
- Inference success rate
- Inference errors
- Inference p95 latency
- Model processing p95
- Memory usage
- Pod replacement and restart visibility

### Platform

- Pod CPU and memory usage
- Node CPU and memory usage
- Pod lifecycle behavior
- Cluster-wide restart visibility

### CMS / EC2

- EC2 status check alarm
- EC2 CPU utilization alarm

Disk and memory alarms were intentionally not implemented yet because the CMS instance does not currently run the CloudWatch Agent required for those custom metrics.

## Alerting

Alerting was added using:

- Grafana-managed alerts for Kubernetes and service-level signals
- Terraform-managed CloudWatch alarms for CMS infrastructure health

Configured alert categories include:

- API 5xx error rate
- API high latency
- API pod replacement/restart behavior
- AI inference latency
- AI inference errors
- AI pod replacement/restart behavior
- Platform pod health signals
- CMS EC2 status check failure
- CMS CPU utilization

Alert thresholds use pending periods to reduce noise from short-lived dev failures.

## Failure Validation

Controlled failure scenarios were used to validate observability behavior:

- API dependency degradation
- API pod replacement / Kubernetes self-healing
- Sustained AI dependency outage
- Application-level error generation
- Platform pod lifecycle visibility

These tests confirmed that the dashboards can show failure symptoms, identify the impacted layer, and confirm recovery behavior.

## Reliability Model

SLIs and production-style SLOs were defined for:

- API availability and latency
- AI inference success and latency
- Downstream dependency health
- CMS infrastructure health

Although validated in a dev environment, the metrics and alerting model were designed to simulate production reliability practices.

---

# 🔁 Rollback Strategy

Rollback is Git-driven:
- Revert GitOps commit
- ArgoCD re-syncs cluster
- Previous version is restored

This ensures:
- fast recovery
- no manual cluster changes
- full traceability

---

# 🧠 Key Design Decisions

## Hybrid CI/CD Approach

- GitHub Actions is used for microservices and infrastructure pipelines
- Jenkins is used for the CMS monolith deployed to EC2

This reflects a real-world hybrid architecture where:
- Kubernetes workloads follow GitOps practices
- Simpler internal systems prioritize operational simplicity

## Hybrid Runtime Architecture

- API and AI services run on EKS for scalability
- CMS runs on EC2 due to lower concurrency and simpler requirements

This avoids unnecessary complexity while maintaining flexibility.
